I've probably lost track of how many times I've written that... Anyway, my name is **Gonzalo**, but my friends call me **Gon**. Let's say you can call me that too—after all, from this moment on, we’re "friends," right? _Hehe._

So, what’s this place all about? Well, let’s just call it what it is: a **junkyard**. I know, I know—it doesn’t sound very promising. But hear me out. This blog (if we can even call it that) isn’t going to be some structured, polished corner of the web, nor will it follow any particular philosophy or theme.

Think of it more like a collection of my **random thoughts, ideas, and ramblings**—kind of like that messy drawer in your desk that you never really clean up, but you know exactly what's in there and where to find it. In the past, I’d jot these things down in my notebook, but now I’m giving them a bit more form, forcing myself to research, learn, and reflect a little deeper.

So, **welcome to my digital chaos**! I hope, in some way, it helps me organize my thoughts... or maybe just makes the mess look a bit more interesting.
